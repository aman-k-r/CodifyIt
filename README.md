## Project Highlights

- **Real-time Collaborative Coding Platform**: Developed a platform using React, Node.js, and Socket.io, enabling multiple users to join a shared "room" to code together or view others' progress.
- **Live Code Execution**: Integrated live code execution and compiler features, allowing users to write, test, and debug code in various languages directly within the platform.
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Leveraged Socket.io for real-time communication to synchronize code changes, updates, and user interactions across connected clients.
- **Responsive UI**: Built a responsive and interactive UI with React and Bootstrap, ensuring seamless user experience across devices while maintaining scalability and performance.


-**There can be issue in the proper working of code due to update in the version of code mirror .**
